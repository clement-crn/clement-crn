I'm a passionate developer with 2 years of experience in full-stack development, working on projects involving:
- **Languages**: JavaScript, Node.js, and PostgreSQL.
- **Frameworks**: React.js, Tailwind, and Dockerized environments.

I am eager to work in the blockchain industry in the near future.
